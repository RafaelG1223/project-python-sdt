Project for Software Development Tools Practicum
This project is about creating a basic web application with some basic parameters. The web app is easy to use, all you have to do to filter out certain conditions of vehicles is click on the legend. You can also filter out any price above 75k for the histogram using the checkbox. To launch the web app on your local machine just type: "streamlit run app.py" in CLI. Make sure you have streamlit installed and are in the folder of the repository.
